# Symbols
The assembler supports many different kinds of symbols. Symbols are used to refer to memory addresses, constants, strings and macros.

## Labels
One of the assembler's main tasks is to keep track of addresses so you don't have to remember obscure numbers but can use a meaningful name instead - a label. Labels are always placed at the beginning of a line.

Labels end with zero, one or two colons. If the label ends with two colons it will be automatically exported.

Symbols and labels are always case-sensitive.

### Global labels
Global labels start with a character from A to Z (or their lower case equivalents) or an underscore. After that the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, @ and # may be used. 

A global label also marks the beginning of a new scope for local labels.

```
GlobalLabel
AnotherGlobalLabel:
ExportedLabel::
```

### Local labels
The assembler supports local labels. Local labels start with the . character, followed by a character in the range a-z, A-Z or an underscore, after which the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, @ and # may be used. Alternatively a local label may simply be a decimal integer followed by the character $.

A local label is considered local to the scope in which it is defined, a scope begins with a global label and ends with the next global label.

Local labels can only be referenced by name within the scope they are defined.

```
GlobalLabel:
.locallabel
42$                 ; also a local label
AnotherGlobalLabel:
```

It is however also possible to refer to a label from outside its scope, by prefixing it with its scope name:

```
    move.l  Scope.local,d0
```

There is a slight ambiguity with 68000 assembly code, for instance `move.w (Symbol.w,a0),d0` is a valid construct, but `Symbol.w` is ambiguous. `.w` as size specifier takes precedence, but if `.w` is a local label in the `Symbol` scope, a backslash can be placed before the local label name, such as `move.w (Symbol\.w,a0),d0`. A backslash is always allowed before the local label name, but this practice is discouraged.

### <a name="import_export"></a> Exporting and importing labels

Most of the time programs consist of several source files that are assembled individually and the resulting object files then linked into an executable. This improves the time spent assembling and helps manage a project.

To export a symbol (to let other source files use the symbol,) you use the keyword ```EXPORT``` (or its synonym ```XDEF```) followed by the symbol that should be exported. To import a symbol (to make an externally defined symbol available in the current source file,) the keyword ```IMPORT``` (or its synonym ```XREF```) is used.

Instead of using ```EXPORT``` or ```XDEF``` to export a label, the label may end with two colons.

Often you will want to make a header file for these definitions that other source files can include for easy access to the symbols you have exported. However, if you want to include the file in the file defining the labels, for instance if it contains structure definitions, it becomes slightly complicated - if a symbol is first imported in the include file and later appears as a label, you have multiple definitions of the symbol.

The assembler provides a third keyword, ```GLOBAL```, that either imports or exports a symbol, depending on whether it appears as a global label in the current source file.

```
EXPORT        GlobalLabel
XREF          ImportedLabel
GLOBAL        AnotherImport,AnExportedLabel
GlobalLabel:
AnExportedLabel:
AutomaticExport::
```

## <a name="integer_symbols"></a> Integer symbols
Instead of hardcoding constants it's often better to give them a name. The assembler supports two kinds of integer symbols, one that is constant and one that may change its value during assembling. The assembler instruction ```EQU``` is used to define constants and ```SET``` is used for variables. Instead of ```SET``` it's also possible use ```=```. Note that an integer symbol is never followed by a colon.

```
INTF_MASTER EQU $4000
MyCounter   SET 0
MyCounter   =   MyCounter+1 ;Increment MyCounter
```

Like labels, constants can also be exported - if the chosen object format supports it.

### <a name="rs_symbols"></a> RS symbols
Integer symbols are often used to define the offsets of structure members or enumerations. While the ```EQU``` instruction can be used for this it quickly becomes cumbersome when adding, reordering or removing members from the structure. The assembler provides a group of instructions to make this easier, the ```RS``` group of instructions.

| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ```RSRESET``` | Resets the ```__RS``` counter to zero |
| ```RSSET constexpr``` | Sets the ```__RS``` counter to the value of constexpr |
| ```Symbol __RSB constexpr``` | Sets ```Symbol``` to ```__RS``` and adds ```constexpr``` to ```__RS``` |
| ```Symbol __RSW constexpr``` | Sets ```Symbol``` to ```__RS``` and adds 2*```constexpr``` to ```__RS``` |
| ```Symbol __RSL constexpr``` | Sets Symbol to ```__RS``` and adds 4*```constexpr``` to ```__RS``` |

The ```__RSB```, ```__RSW``` and ```__RSL``` directives are always available as a portable way to define RS symbols. The different CPUs use different conventions and have other, possibly more convenient, aliases available:

| Portable | 6502 | Z80 | M68K | MIPS | DCPU-16 | SCHIP | 6809 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ```__RSB``` | ```RB``` | ```RB``` | ```RS.B``` | ```RB``` | n/a | ```RB``` | ```RB``` |
| ```__RSW``` | ```RW``` | ```RW``` | ```RS.W``` | ```RH``` | ```RW``` | ```RW``` | ```RW``` |
| ```__RSL``` | ```RL``` | n/a | ```RS.L``` | ```RW``` | ```RL``` | n/a | n/a |

Example:
```
           RSRESET
str_pStuff RW 1
str_tData  RB 256
str_bCount RB 1
str_SIZEOF RB 0
```

Result:
| Symbol | Value |
|---|---|
| ```str_pStuff``` | 0 |
| ```str_tData``` | 2 |
| ```str_bCount``` | 258 |
| ```str_SIZEOF``` | 259 |

A more convenient way of defining structures is also possible with the `RS` directives. `RSRESET` and `RSSET` can also be used with a label that will begin a scope. The structure above might also be defined as:

```
MyStruct RSRESET
.pStuff  RW 1
.tData   RB 256
.bCount  RB 1
         RSEND
```

This will create a scope and local symbols that may be accessed using the normal local label mechanism, eg. `MyStruct.pStuff`, `MyStruct.SIZEOF` and so forth. The symbol `MyStruct` will contain the last value of the `__RS` symbol, in this case the value after the last `RB` statement, 259. To define storage for a structure of this kind, one can then simply use `DS MyStruct`.

## <a name="string_symbols"></a> String symbols
String symbols are used to assign a name to an often used string. These symbols are expanded to their value whenever the assembler encounters the assigned name.

Example:
```
COUNTREG EQUS "[hl+]"
         ld   a,COUNTREG
```

Interpreted as:
```
         ld   a,[hl+]
```

String symbols can also be used to define small macros:
```
PUSHA    EQUS "push af\npush bc\npush de\npush hl\n"
```

Note that string symbols cannot be used in place of a string literal directly - their value is parsed by the assembler. To insert a string symbol as a string, enclose it in pipe symbols:

```
    DC.B |StringSymbol|,0
```

When using a string symbol, the symbol must be a stand-alone token. That is, it must be surrounded by whitespace or other delimiting non-symbol characters, such as other operators.

This will produce two symbols called `symbol` and `symbol0`, where one might expect `symbol` and `content0`.

```
symbol	EQUS	"content"
symbol0	EQUS	"..."
```

To force parse a preceding string symbol as its contents, the postfix concatenating operator `#` can be used. This example will produce the symbols `symbol` and `content0`:

```
symbol		EQUS	"content"
symbol#0	EQUS	"..."
```


## <a name="group_symbols"></a> Group symbols
Though rarely used, it is however possible to define new groups for use with the ```SECTION``` directive.
These groups are also present in the object file for later consumption by a linker. Two different kinds can be defined, ```TEXT``` and ```RAM```.

```
MyCode  GROUP   TEXT
MyRAM   GROUP   RAM

        SECTION "Example",MyCode
        ; ...
```


## Predeclared symbols
The assembler declares several symbols:

| Name | Contents | Type |
|---|---|---|
| ```@```, ```*``` | Current PC value | EQU |
| ```__RS``` | __RS counter | SET |
| ```__NARG``` | Number of arguments passed to macro | EQU |
| ```__LINE``` | The current line number | EQU |
| ```__FILE``` | The current filename | EQUS |
| ```__DATE``` | Todays date | EQUS |
| ```__TIME``` | The current time | EQUS |
| ```__AMIGADATE``` | The current date in Amiga version format (dd.mm.yyyy) | EQUS |

## <a name="purge"></a> Removing symbols

Symbols may be removed from the symbol table by use of the ```PURGE``` directive. This is seldom necessary, but it can be very useful in macros, especially with temporary string symbols. Often you can simply postfix labels with \@ to keep them local to the macro instead.

```
Symbol  EQUS "push\n"   ; define Symbol

        Symbol          ; Use Symbol

        PURGE Symbol    ; Undefine it
```
